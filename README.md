# 📈 AI Stock Picker Agent (CrewAI)
**Multi-Agent Financial Intelligence System for Automated Investment Decisions**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **multi-agent financial analysis system** that autonomously:

- Identifies **trending companies** from real-world news  
- Performs **deep financial research**  
- Selects the **best investment opportunity**  
- Sends a **real-time push notification** with the decision  

The system uses a **hierarchical agent architecture with memory**, simulating how real investment teams collaborate and make decisions.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Trending Company Finder**

   * Scans latest news to identify 2–3 trending companies

2. **Financial Researcher**

   * Performs detailed analysis:

     * Market position
     * Future outlook
     * Investment potential

3. **Stock Picker**

   * Evaluates all research
   * Selects the best investment
   * Provides justification

4. **Push Notification Tool**

   * Sends final decision to the user in real-time
